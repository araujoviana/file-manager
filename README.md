# File Manager
A very simple file manager written in Python

## Description

A simple Python file manager made in Dear PyGui, should work in all operating systems but I haven't tested it on a non-linux machine.

Despite its name, the file manager can't do much beyond opening files *(for now)*.

## Features

1. Lists files and directories
2. Displays file size, mimetype and last modification date
3. Navigates through the system
4. Opens files with default system programs
5. Other things I might add in the future

## Instalation

1. Clone the repository:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/araujoviana/file-manager
```

2. Install dependencies:

``` shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Just run the main file:

``` shell
python main.py
```
